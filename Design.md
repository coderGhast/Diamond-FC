# Design Outline for Diamond FC

## Purpose

This website would be for Diamond Free Company (DMD FC) on Gilgamesh to reach out to the Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV) community. 



## Functionality





- Pages for: home, about us, guild events, raid teams, streams, join/apply, log links

Shout out page? where do crafters belong, aren't they super important (q from turtle)

Landing page: 'glory shots' of raid clears

Right hand/left hand side:
- Social media linkes (facebook, twiter, YT, twitch)
- Discord link
- Contact info for raid team leaders (for applications)
- Council memeber contact info?

Possible future additions: player directory/profiles! (turtle's idea)

Technologies to consider:
Python vs JS for framework?
Nginx for server?
Https server? (letsencrypt)
Need URL
How to store images/info - AWS S3, Azure, Google GCP, Scality opensource S3
React frontend? Someone has to do CSS
Color scheme: blue, white, black
Logo: is it plagiarized?


Backend engine: simple API server, fetch images/data from cloud, send to website


No database :( sad

Good example: www.eternal-kingdom.com

Do we want blog posts to be added through online portal, or redeploy web server to update posts?
